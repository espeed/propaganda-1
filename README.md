# propaganda

The objective of this project is to create an extinsible propagator library for Clojure. Propagators define a computational model not completely unlike that found in FRP, but with some differences. They are described in the article "The Art of the Propagator".

Along with the library itself, the project should supply documentation of the API, good examples and tutorials.

I have not previously worked with propagtors, so this will also be an exploration for me.

## Tutorial

The `gh-pages` branch of this project contains a brief explanation of the basics of the propagator computational model. The page can be visited [here](http://tgk.github.io/propaganda/).
